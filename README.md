# Route Planner

In this project, I have implemented a route planner between two points on a map using A* search algorithm. The map is a grid with some cells blocked and some cells unblocked. The cost of moving from one cell to another is 1. The heuristic used is the Euclidean distance between the current cell and the goal cell.
